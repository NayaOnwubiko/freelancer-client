
# Freelancer App

I created a functional clone of the Fiverr Application to further enhance my skills in React and Express with Node js, this time incorporating a non relational database (MongoDB) in this case.

Freelancer App helps connect freelancers with people looking to hire their services.

## Requirements
This app requires the following modules & dependencies:
*Axios
*Tanstack React Query
*Infinite React Carousel
*Moment
*React Router Dom
*Sass
*Stripe

## Installation

1. Install with npm

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```

2. Install Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
**Vite is a build tool I used and from experience is faster than create-react-app

3. Install Sass, Axios, React Router Dom, Infinite-React-Carousel, Stripe-Js, Moment, Tanstack-React-Query (npm install <package_name>)
***Refer to each library's website for the latest package installation instructions
